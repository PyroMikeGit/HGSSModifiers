Note: At the moment I only have a patch for HeartGold since that's the game I run, but I'll work on a SoulSilver patch is someone asks for it, just ping me in the [IronMON Discord Server](https://discord.gg/Z5aruYafq4) (ID: @Pyro#1111)

I will be updating this patch later on if I find other stuff that I want to fix so feel free to suggest some fixes you want to make.
