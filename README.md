Note: At the moment I only have a patch for HeartGold since that's the game I run, but I'll work on a SoulSilver patch is someone asks for it, just ping me in the [IronMON Discord Server](https://discord.gg/Z5aruYafq4) (ID: @Pyro#1111)

## Credits:

Huge thanks to SilverstarStream and Foulton for making the Intro Patch that this patch was built off of as well and also making my resets so much faster.

Also massive shoutouts to OnlySpaghettiCode and UTDZac for making the GBA/NDS IronMON trackers, GalacticElliot getting me interested in HGSS IronMON to create this patch, and the folks in the Kingdom of DS Hacking Discord server for their modding guides!
