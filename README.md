## Patch Details:
Modified version of the [IronMON HGSS Patch (V0.2.2a)](https://github.com/PyroMikeGit/IronMONHGSS) with custom run modifiers for Tournaments/Fun IronMON runs.

# Current Available Modifiers:
1. Randomize all Party Pokemon after each trainer battle (Excluding Important Trainers: Gym Leaders, E4, Rival, etc) --> Battle Modifiers
2. Randomize all moves for Party Pokemon after each trainer battle (Excluding Important Trainers: Gym Leaders, E4, Rival, etc) --> Battle Modifiers

Speak to any overworld Quagsire in the Pokemon Center or Professor Elm's Lab to enable these run modifiers.
